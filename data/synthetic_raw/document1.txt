Team,

Following up on yesterday’s steering review, here’s the consolidated update for Q3. Please share with your leads and add clarifications inline where noted.

1. Context
   We’re seeing sustained backlog in the Mountain and Southwest regions due to carrier shortfalls (avg. 2.4 days behind SLA). The biggest driver is the Phoenix cross-dock throughput (temporary staff turnover + two conveyors down). Denver and SLC are stable but running at low buffer.

2. Forecast & Risk
   • Units forecast: 412k (+6.1% vs Q2)
   • Fill rate risk: 2.7–3.3% if supplier B can’t restore aluminum extrusions by W31
   • Top blocker: Truckload capacity out of Nogales; spot market rates up ~18% since June

3. Mitigations (owner → due)
   • Vendor B recovery plan — materials ETA W30; alt. profile acceptable for SKUs X12/X14 (Priya → W29)
   • Phoenix temp staffing — convert 12 FTEs; weekend overtime cap +10% (Marco → rolling)
   • Expedite lanes — authorize 4 weekly TLs PHX→ABQ, ABQ→DEN (Nate → W28)
   • Safety stock — raise to 2.2 wks for X-series; revisit by W32 (Lana → W31)

4. Customer Impact & Comms
   CSAT dipped to 4.31 (−0.08). Comms plan: proactive delay notices for orders >48h past promised-ship; target 24h resolution on re-routes. No changes to warranty policy.

5. Financials
   Freight variance: +$218k MTD vs plan (expedites + spot). Expect ~+$600–$720k for the quarter if constraints persist through W33.

6. Notes for next review
   Please append any site-level anomalies (one-liners) before Thursday 3pm PT so we can lock the exec deck.
