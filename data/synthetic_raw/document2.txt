The Skyfire Ducks

Once, long before humans built cities of steel, there was a kingdom hidden among the reeds of the silver marsh. It was ruled not by kings or queens, but by ducks—majestic, golden-feathered beings who could speak in thunder and command the winds.
Every dawn, their leader, Auris the Drake, would rise from the mirror-still water and summon the flock to flight. As their wings cut the sky, sparks of fire trailed behind them, painting the heavens with streaks of orange and crimson. The villagers who lived nearby whispered that the sunrise itself was born from those fiery feathers.
But one night, the moon grew jealous. It sent shadows to creep into the marsh and steal away the ducks’ voices, so that they could no longer sing the storm or summon the light. Silence fell, and the dawn did not come.
It was a lone duckling, barely old enough to fly, who dared defy the moon. With feathers still mottled grey, she dove into the heart of the shadow, carrying nothing but a shard of starlight in her beak. The moon laughed, but the duckling broke the shard against its face, scattering stars across the heavens and tearing the shadows apart.
From then on, the flock’s flames burned brighter than ever. Each sunrise was a victory cry, each sunset a reminder that even the smallest duck can outshine the darkness.
And so, when you see the sky blaze with impossible colors at dawn, remember: the ducks are still flying, their wings setting the day alight.
