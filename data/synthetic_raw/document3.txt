Review: Titanic (1997)
James Cameron’s Titanic is as grand in scale as the ill-fated ship itself. More than 25 years after its release, it remains both a sweeping romance and a visual spectacle that defined blockbuster cinema of the 1990s.
The film tells the fictional story of Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a penniless artist, and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), a young woman trapped in the rigid expectations of high society. Their love blossoms aboard the RMS Titanic, but the romance is cut short by one of history’s most infamous maritime disasters.
Where Titanic excels is in its blending of personal intimacy with large-scale tragedy. Cameron’s meticulous attention to detail—down to the ship’s interiors, passenger customs, and even the sequence of the iceberg collision—anchors the spectacle in authenticity. The visual effects, groundbreaking at the time, still hold up remarkably well, particularly in the haunting final act as the ship breaks apart.
The performances elevate the film beyond mere melodrama. Winslet’s Rose is a compelling portrait of defiance and longing, while DiCaprio brings charm and vulnerability to Jack. Their chemistry sells the romance that, in lesser hands, might have seemed contrived. Supporting performances, especially by Billy Zane as the controlling fiancé Cal, add tension and contrast.
Is the dialogue occasionally heavy-handed? Absolutely. Does the runtime feel indulgent at over three hours? Perhaps. But these excesses are part of what make Titanic unforgettable. It is a film that unabashedly aims for grandeur, both emotional and cinematic, and more often than not, it succeeds.
Verdict: A sweeping, emotionally charged epic that blends romance, disaster, and history into a cinematic experience that still resonates today.
